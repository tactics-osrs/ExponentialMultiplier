# Exponential Multiplier

This is a simple batch script titled "Exponential Multiplier" that performs exponential multiplication of the number 2, up to a maximum of 5 times. 

## Features
- The script prompts the user to input the number of times they want to perform the exponential multiplication.
- It validates the user input to ensure it is within the valid range (2-5).
- The script then performs the exponential multiplication, displaying the result after each multiplication.
- If the user inputs 'why' instead of a number, the script explains why the maximum limit is set to 5, due to the 32-bit limitation of the command prompt.

## Usage
Just run the script, input the number of times you want to multiply (between 2 and 5), and watch the magic happen!
